        <h2>Journey's End</h2>

    <p>
        I experienced a minor jolt of culture shock stepping off the train in Geneva. Vevey, the station from which I boarded earlier that morning, was small and the crowd was sparse. Prior to that, stations in Interlaken were mostly open-air hubs or tiny enclosed structures. In contrast, Geneva was a large(ish) international city and its train station had to support the numbers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Descending into the lower floors, I entered a chaotic stream of international travelers and morning commuters. We paced through a mall with signs pointing to places I didn’t need to go, escalators leading everywhere and nowhere, and exits in a multitude of directions at various levels. In the colorful mess, I tried to navigate but my phone’s GPS couldn’t locate itself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was 9 a.m. and within an hour, I needed to find my hotel, check in, and walk to the starting point of a chocolate tour. I must’ve looked flustered moving toward an exit because an older gentleman eyed me and asked whether I needed help with directions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        “I’m looking for a hotel - le Montbrillant”, I said.
        “La Rue Montbrillant,” he told me, “it’s next to the station, in that direction”.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That simple gesture was enough to help me recenter. I walked to my hotel, checked in, and made it to my tour’s meeting spot with time to spare. The rest of the morning was spent chatting with fellow tourists as a guide relayed fun stories about chocolate, Geneva’s Old Town, and how they crossed in history.

        The following day was my last in Switzerland. That morning, I moved my belongings to a hotel near the airport, circled back to the middle of Geneva, and rented a bike to continue my explorations. Far too soon, the game of navigating streets and crowds in search of unique sights, sounds and feelings was over.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With evening on its way, I was in the sad process of returning to my hotel. I chose a bus stop five minutes from Geneva’s train station - a spot that's much easier to manage than the central bus platform.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I was on the side of the station facing away from the Rhône. Everything is quieter here. I was nearly alone on the streets. I carried a simple dinner in a grocery bag and sang as I walked.  Mid-song, a slight, older lady with a rolling suitcase approached and asked, “Are you a local?”.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I wasn’t but told her I might be able to help.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    “I’m lost,” she said, “I’m looking for Hotel les Arcades.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I dug it up on my phone, showed her the map, and said, “It’s on the other side of the station.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
    She flashed me a look of exhaustion and frustration so I followed with, “do you want me to walk with you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We ducked into the station, passed the now-familiar convenience stores and cafes, rode down one set of escalators, and rode up another. I told her it was my last day in Geneva and I was happy to have an excuse to stay a little longer. She laughed. She called me an angel - how unexpected and sweet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We exited and walked up a short flight of concrete steps. I was quietly amused by the small mass of people gathered around a furniture store window. There was a TV broadcasting Wimbledon Finals.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I pointed at my phone. I pointed to a line of buildings, “it’s somewhere over there”. We walked over. To our confusion, signs for the hotel were nowhere in sight. The lady had come this way earlier and she’d been advised to walk in the opposite direction, away from the river.
    </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>
    I realized the building also had entrances from a street parallel to ours. It seemed risky and inconsiderate to drag a tired person bearing luggage somewhere just to satisfy a hunch. Instead, I suggested asking for directions in the hotel next to us.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The hotel’s interior was extravagant in a muted, classy way - large slabs of fancy wood and rich, warm lighting. The lady said it was embarrassing but talked to the concierge anyway. She switched from English to French with ease. He was kind and confirmed the entrance is on the parallel street.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We walked over. The way into Les Arcades was tiny - a single glass door with a buzzer and a camera. The lady pushed the buzzer and relayed her reservation details. Someone in an upper floor disabled the lock. Before disappearing up the stairs, the lady opened her arms for a warm hug. It had been a long travel day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    “Have a good night,” I said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I returned to my stop alone. I carried a simple dinner in a grocery bag and sang as I walked. Then it dawned on me: I was singing <i>Into The West</i> by Annie Lennox, a highlight from the childhood of a nerdy kid. Its first verse is below.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <div class="poetry">
    Lay down your sweet and weary head<br>
    Night is falling, you have come to journey’s end<br>
    Sleep now and dream of the ones who came before<br>
    They are calling from across a distant shore<br>
    <br>
    Why do you weep? What are these tears upon your face?<br>
    Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away.<br>
    Safe in my arms, you’re only sleeping ...<br>
    </div>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I sing it so often I'd become blind to the lyrics but suddenly, I understood why, perhaps, on the quiet side of the station facing away from the Rhône, she had approached me.
    </p>
