        <h2>Second Impressions</h2>

    <p>
        Day one, a Saturday morning: stepping out a side entrance of Zürich’s Main Station, I wasn’t impressed. The sky was overcast. Buildings seemed worn. The streets looked dirty. I descended back into the station’s depths and re-emerged at the front entrance. I faced a street lined with chain stores. The clean, classicist architecture seemed... uninspired.

        Wandering the city center, I waited to be struck by the beauty of Switzerland. At a table overlooking the Linmat, I drank a small-but-potent cup of coffee and savored the light summer breeze blowing in from Lake Zürich. I studied the flotsam as if the act would call forth some magic - feathers, lilies, dead leaves. The sturdy, smooth harmonies of a distant alphorn demonstration wafted through. On the opposite bank, a boy dangled his legs over concrete lining the water's edge.

        I walked on, crossed a small stone bridge, and stepped into a church. A choir was rehearsing something airy, polyphonic, baroque - a simple motif stamped across pitch and space and time. The tenor’s voice lifted me above the pews. Lovely! But not exactly something I couldn't seek out at home.

        I set off on the half-hour trek to Google’s Zürich office. Hiking boots weren’t appropriate in the heat. It rained lightly and sporadically. Few people occupied the sidewalks so I was wary about leaving the safety of a bustling city center. In spite of the minor discomforts, I pressed on and was rewarded with air conditioning, water, and an opportunity to recharge my phone. The office itself was somewhat ordinary and smaller than expected.

        A friend had once gushed about his lunch-hour stroll from the Zürich office to a nearby park. I walked a circuit, crossing through the park. I was reminded of my hometown - a paved bike path next to running water, a simple, pretty greenness. Everything was bright and fresh. Nearby stucco buildings called back foreign neighborhoods with less stellar reputations for safety so I eyed the area with suspicion and didn’t wander further.

        Eventually, I returned to the city center and explored a museum in a giant, friendly historic mansion. I left at closing time and checked into an AirBnB fifteen minutes away. Just outside my bedroom, the festival that was building up all morning was approaching a loud, crowded, sunny apex.

        Near dinner time, I met with a friend. It was impossible to make conversation in the waterside din so she suggested walking to the Google office. Okay - round two. I was tired and my feet were sore but I was glad to be there with her, whatever the activity. We lost our sense of direction meandering through a thick, leafy, well-kempt garden. We tried to catch a bus but realized walking would be faster. I learned from her that the water flowing from fountains in Switzerland is potable (unless signs state otherwise). She demonstrated the concept by drinking directly from the spout of an ornate fountain with a circular basin. We passed the Google office and kept going.

        “Is the area safe?” I asked.
        “Yes - very,” she responded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We entered a modern-looking mall and she purchased something from a sports equipment store - a small errand. We walked into a cafeteria-style restaurant and she ordered pasta in a well-practiced beginner’s German. We watched a chef deftly prepare our dishes.
    </p>

        It was like the skies broke and the streets widened. Areas that seemed shady suddenly became familiar and accessible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Circling back to Google’s offices, my friend showed me a dark room with a wall of fish tanks and leather recliners. We walked to an upper floor with panoramic windows and met strangers who were waiting for nightfall to catch Züri Fäscht fireworks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Züri Fäscht: the summer street festival celebrating Zürich occurs once every three years. Each cycle hits you at a different stage of life.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Eventually, alone in the half light, I confidently made my way back to the city center. I was greeted by youthful, effervescent ravers, a percussion ensemble so loud and exuberant I could feel my feet vibrate against the cobblestones, and kiddies holding up transparent balloons that blinked with LED lights. The streets were overflowing. I could sense an energy surging through the city. I felt tapped in, welcomed, and ready to explore.
