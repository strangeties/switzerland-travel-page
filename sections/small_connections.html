        I was walking from Trümmelbach Falls to Lauterbrunnen - the homestretch after a long day that involved parasailing and ample hiking. The trail was flanked by sheer cliffs, snow-capped peaks, and more than fifteen waterfalls - the definition of idyllic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I was tired, though, and I’d been staring at the same green pastures, sweet chalets, and miniature farms for hours. There were no clouds in sight and I missed the air of mystery and instability they lent.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A sign pointing to Lauterbruennen said “35 minutes”. I read it out loud in an exasperated whine, my body sinking forward. “35 minUTES?” A man sitting on a nearby bench burst out laughing. We shared a smile and - perhaps - a fuzzy thought involving paradise and parking lots.

    I was eating dinner on a large wooden deck in Mürren. The town sloped upwards to the west and the setting sun was already lost from view, hidden somewhere behind the Schiltorn. The sky was clear - no clouds obscured the sight of stately mountain tops on the opposite side of the valley. The sunset cast a mild reddish glow on everything, making the entire scene feel otherworldly, almost Martian.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    While dining on stewed venison, chestnuts, and candied pear, I studied my placemat, which had an illustration of nearby mountain tops. I played at matching mountains in the illustration to the red-tinted ones in real life.

    A group of kids sat at a table near mine. Their parents were at another table, discussing work. As I was eating, the kids, who were waiting on meals to arrive, commented loudly - “I want what SHE’S eating”, “What is that? It looks so good!” I couldn’t help but laugh and look over, feeling self-conscious and amused. When they realized I understood English, a preteen in braces - the eldest - became mortified. She laughed and apologized and the kids moved on.

    It’s interesting how the dominant language changed as I traveled up the Alps. At the base, I heard a mixture of German, French, English, and Italian. By the time I reached Mürren, all I heard were snippets of English conversation - medical doctors discussing the pointlessness of data scientists in their field, devout parents proselytizing to their kids, women in yoga gear relaying stories about self development.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Talking to my tandem parasailing guide, I was told that most Swiss don’t venture so far up the mountain because the views in Mürren can be seen anywhere in Switzerland. The following day, on a train to Montreux, I gazed out at the verdant countryside and understood.

    Two men from San Diego were sitting, facing me on a train in Interlaken Ost. I told them I lived in the Bay Area. We laughed about how summer in the Alps was basically winter in San Diego.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I have never been to San Diego before. I kept that fact to myself.

    The bus to the UN dropped me off at a large sunny plaza with an array of tall water spouts and a giant chair with a broken leg. Signs at the front entrance to the Palace of Nations stated guided tours would congregate at 2 pm - a mere 10 minutes from my drop-off time. There were no lines, just a few tourists snapping photos. I double-checked: no meeting place was specified.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I asked a lone teen whether he was planning on attending the tour. He said yes but he also didn’t know where to go. He’d investigated a smaller entrance at the back but it was closed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I eventually found instructions online. They suggested waiting at the back entrance. The Palace of Nations wouldn't be open the following day. Overtaken by a miniature bout of paranoia, I wondered, what if I was misreading it? In walking back and forth, would I miss the narrow window in which guests would be allowed to enter? Would I make it, only to be told tickets were sold out?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I hurried to the back. The shaded path was delightful but I mostly ignored it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I saw a group of three boys and asked if they were headed to the UN. They countered with, “The UN’s open on Saturdays?” They were planning to check out Musée Ariana and advised me to talk to guards near the bus stop to get more information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    How can so few tourists be around and how can they be so blasé about a guided tour of the UN? As I walked, I started considering alternatives - consolation prizes - such as the Red Cross museum across the street. Eventually, I reached the back gate and, to my relief, I saw a group of school kids in matching t-shirts and a proto-line of three individuals. At roughly the same time, the first boy stepped into the scene.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Standing on concrete, we baked in the sun for several long minutes. Finally, a cashier opened up. The first boy approached, exchanged words, and gestured at me - everything was a go. Soon after, the second group of boys came around as well (I wasn't suprised - Musée Ariana’s full of old ceramics and glassware).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We had all made it.
