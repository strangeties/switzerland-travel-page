        <h2>Anticipation</h2>

    <p>
        Intermingled with the anticipation, I felt a weird sense of guilt. I’m accustomed to having strong excuses for travel - weddings, family visits, conferences, training... To venture far away just because <b>I</b> want to - what an unacknowledged, untapped privilege.

        I surveyed the motley crowd boarding the plane from San Francisco to Paris. One man stuck out. He carried a large Osprey backpack. Prominently around his neck hung one of those superfluous black passport-holders-with-RFID-protection you can buy from REI. His t-shirt, a deep blue with grey and orange heathers, was also from REI. I imagined the cool, rubbery texture of moisture-wick fabric. Expensive gear. Privileged techie. Travel rookie. Clueless tourist. Actually, I was judging a modest reflection of myself. I also carried an oversized, overstuffed Osprey backpack to avoid checking in baggage that may be lost between airports.

        What if I’m wasting time and money? Who am I to embark on an unnecessary, “unearned” trip like this? Am I being selfish?

        I walked through an aisle of the plane, smiled at a seatmate who requested a swap, hoisted my bag into an overhead compartment, and sat down.
