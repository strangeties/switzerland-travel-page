        <h2>WWJD?</h2>

    <p>
        It was early evening on my first day in Bern and I couldn’t decide what to do next.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It had been a full morning. I’d arrived on a 9 a.m. train, regrouped with coffee in the small, impersonal cafe below my hostel, and taken off for the day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I’d been charmed. I marvelled at the storied limestone buildings with their balconnets and thin overhangs, the fanfare of flags crowding over narrow streets, the wide arcades sheltering chain stores and tourist boutiques, the baroque fountains flanked by tram tracks below and criss-crossing power lines above, the rooftop gardens and fairytale spires, the lush green yonder, and the chalky blue, fast-flowing Aare that tied everything together. Exploring, I made quick work of the Bear Pit, reposed in the Rose Garden, and read every sign in the humble apartment-turned-museum that Einstein once shared with his first wife. I watched tourists wander, carefree, up and down the cobblestone roads (much to the annoyance of bus and tram drivers). In the Zytglogge, I studied the knotted, intricate mess of gears that caused bells to chime every fifteen minutes and listened to a guide discuss the layers of history on which the Old Town was built.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My day hadn’t completely panned out as planned. Because it was Sunday, sites I’d expected to be open were closed. Because the city expanded on a European scale rather than a Californian scale, walking anywhere had taken much less time than anticipated. Once my eyes had adjusted to the norms of the Old Town, I felt ready to escape what, I decided, was a bright, medieval fantasy of a holiday district.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was early evening on my first day in Bern and I had just awoken from a nap. I was raring to have another go at... everything.

    <p>
        Although I traveled solo, I wasn’t really alone. I carried my parents and friends in a pocket and we exchanged regular updates. Through the magic of LTE, I had access to maps, blogs, schedules and facts strewn behind by everyone who came before me (in some ways, a veritable Hitchhiker’s Guide). In my mind, I also toyed with the concept, WWJD.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WWJD: “what would J do?” J doesn’t stand for Jesus. J is a stand-in for a couple of friends I admire for their resourcefulness, aplomb, desire to live experiences to their fullest, and ability to optimize things to death.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WWJD? When friends and I traveled in a pack through Greece two years before, we had sat on a rocky outcrop to catch sights of Athens at sunset. The Bern analogue, a climb to the Rose Garden, would be lowballing it. J would go bigger. J would go to the high point at the outskirts of the city. J would go to the Gürten.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Given the deluge of tourists in Bern's Old Town, I assumed plenty of people would be milling about the grassy hillsides of the Gürten, too. I checked my phone: the sun should set at approximately 9:30 pm. If I were to take the 7:20 bus, arrive by 8:00, and spend 50 minutes hiking up the mountain, I’d be there with time to spare - time that could be spent eating dinner and appreciating a view of hazy tangerine skies and cozy architecture.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Excited by this new mission, I ventured to a sandwich shop, placed an order in broken French, and waited excitedly as the cashier prepared my panini. I didn’t relax until I was sitting on a bus.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On the bus, I saw a group of four empty seats: two facing forward and two facing backward. I chose the forward-facing window seat and let my bag and coat rest beside me. Etiquette dictates I should occupy a single seat; however, with so much space available to others and so few people around, it didn’t particularly matter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I was hungry and nibbled at my sandwich. Suddenly, a large woman rushed in and, without a word, sat down roughly on my bag and coat. I was shocked. I protested out loud. She said something stern in German. I didn’t understand a word but I got her drift. Her home was being overrun by dumb, unruly, inconsiderate tourists.  And something about my looks or demeanor made her assume the worst. I fumed. I wondered whether race had anything to do with it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        She didn't budge as I pulled my coat and bag free from underneath her hefty mass. We sat in silence. The two seats in front of us remained dolefully empty. Eventually, she stood up and walked to the door. I felt a twinge of victory - I had outlasted her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WWJD? J would stand up for herself. As the woman waited for the bus to come to a full stop, I dropped my coat loudly in the seat beside me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A few moments later, my stop arrived. I emerged in a quiet suburbia. Ordinary houses were arranged in neat rows. The only other people to step off was a small family. They strolled off in a direction that wasn’t the Gürten, their arms full of groceries. Where were the crowds?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I walked with purpose and haste. I made a wrong turn and recovered. Finally, I found it: the point where the sidewalk ends. I saw a staircase leading into the beckoning, faded green covers of a forest. I stepped in.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several minutes into my climb, I crossed paths with a lone jogger rushing down the mountain. A miniature waterfall gurgled nearby. Then, for a short interval, my path ran parallel to the tracks of a funicular. More emptiness. My path turned again into deep woods. It was peaceful but I felt a little on edge. WWJD? J knew better than to put herself in risky situations alone. I looked at my phone: it'd be 40 more minutes before I reached the top. And what about getting down? I bid goodbye to the dream of hills and grass and night air and turned around.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On the way down, I made a wrong turn and emerged in a new suburbia. Next to me was a single-story building with large fiberglass windows. It was a gate to the funicular. A few teens sat at its exit ramp. Maybe the train was still running. I walked in.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The interior looked abandoned and the ticket office was closed. I saw a ticket machine and tried to make sense of the foreign text on its screen. I pushed at buttons, hoping to find a hidden, exclusive schedule of evening runs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A voice boomed from a loudspeaker: “WE’RE CLOSED.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WWJD? I tried asking questions but quickly realized English wasn’t in the speaker’s skillset and he wasn’t in the mood to share trade secrets with a clueless tourist. I exited the building.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I navigated to a new bus stop. Sidewalks were mostly empty but I heard the occasional strand of conversation emanating from kitchen windows. At a slightly busier intersection, I stood, waiting for the bus. I watched passing cars. I finished my sandwich.
    </p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>
        It was early evening in Bern’s Old Town and night had yet to fully fall. I stepped off the bus and walked across the city. I passed the Zytglogge and Einstein’s former home. I passed multiple cafes and at least three colorful fountains. I walked across a foot bridge and saw the lightly churning Aare. I passed the Bear Pit and climbed the steep stone path leading up to the Rose Garden.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The crowd had thinned since noon but people still congregated at the concrete wall overlooking the Old Town. Friends chattered, smoked, joked around, or just hung in silence. Some onlookers sat in the grass in front of the wall while others stood behind it. Still others sat on the wall itself. I joined them. Several couples leaned against each other. A lone boy eyed me and I felt old.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For the most part, we all looked in the same direction - toward the town, toward the sky. Peachy hues dimmed into deep blues and purples. Did the street lights just blink on or were they shining the entire time?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        WWJD? Chill. Enjoy the moment.
