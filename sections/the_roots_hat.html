        <h2>The Roots Hat</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        I’m Chinese. I was born in China and moved to Canada with my parents when I was four. In my early twenties, career aspirations brought me to California. For a host of reasons, I’ve grappled with identity my entire life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When I see tourists from East Asia being inconsiderate or rude, sometimes I’m flabbergasted, sometimes I’m annoyed. There’s always an extra pang of annoyance because it feels like they’re wearing a tag with my name while committing a slew of faux pas. Although the wrong ultimately lies in racial stereotyping, it feels like they’re hurting my reputation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sometimes, I overcompensate - I smile, I’m extra agreeable, I roll my eyes. It’s just an attempt at setting myself apart, a way to nonverbally communicate the immature message, “see, I’m one of the good/cool/creative/funny ones who gets it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What’s the benefit of setting myself apart? In Switzerland, I interacted with many, many kind and welcoming people but occasionally, I found them making wrong assumptions about me. A waiter served well-done steak even though I’d asked for medium rare (many people from China feel squeamish about consuming meat that isn’t fully-cooked). A concierge matched me to the wrong room reservation because she mistook the way I said my name for something pinyin-ified that also began with W (it didn’t resemble my name at all). On a bus, a woman ferociously sat on top of my hiking sack (admittedly, it was taking up an empty seat, but there were plenty of other empty seats around). If I can communicate my identity, maybe I’d be treated differently. Maybe these tiresome misunderstandings would happen less often.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These thoughts were in mind as I embarked on a wine cave tour in Lavaux.
    </p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>
        Lutry is a small town at the edge of Lavaux, Lake Geneva’s wine region. Wine produced in the area is sold and consumed within the country. For the rest of us, it’s a rare commodity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Late afternoon on a Friday in Lutry: I sat on a pier overlooking the expansive, calm waters of Lake Geneva, reading and waiting for a wine train ticket window to open. I’d reserved a ticket for a two-hour tour and was excited to compare and contrast the experience against two favorites: Napa Valley and Niagara-on-the-Lake. Around me, kids and families ran about, having fun in the water, next to docked boats, and on a few small play structures. The sun was fierce. A strong breeze blew hair over my eyes so I rotated to face the wind.
    </p>
    
    <div class="centered_img">

    </div>
    
    <p>
        Half an hour before the tour, the ticket window opened. I approached, retrieved my reservation, and was given a small souvenir wine glass stamped with the wine train company’s logo.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A small canteen beside the ticket window offered simple items - baked goods, chips, drinks,  and crepes. I stood in line to grab a quick dinner before the tour.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Among the crowd ahead of me was a Chinese family. Instead of ordering immediately once they reached the register, they dawdled. The mother pulled at her rambunctious kids to ask what they wanted. After a series of scattered interactions, the cashier finally repeated a long list of orders back. With food in hand, the mother said to the cashier in Mandarin, almost conspiratorial, “Thank you - they finally hired someone who can speak Chinese.” The comment felt loaded with entitlement and oblique assumptions. Maybe the cashier sensed it as well. She quickly pointed at her black coworker and said exuberantly, “She speaks Mandarin, too!”. The coworkers hollered a fun, half-nonsensical exchange of Chinese words at each other - adorable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Then the mother approached the wine train ticket counter. She purchased tickets for two families - several adults, several kids. I felt dread at the thought of having a tour guide lump me with their group. I reminded myself that there would be other travelers, too, and my stop-wearing-my-nametag senses were probably just over-amplifying the issue. The loud and rowdy kids continued to be loud and rowdy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At 6:30, I boarded the "train". It was a cutesy series of green open-air carts attached to a driver’s cabin - built to traverse normal roads. My seat mates were a mother and two college-aged daughters. I whispered judgmentally to them, “I can’t believe they’re bringing kids along to a wine tasting.” The moment I said it, I felt silly. I was being so insecure, trying to set myself apart and trying to ingratiate myself with the only travelers from a western background. The family shrugged it off. We were all tourists on holiday. Families are welcome. They were right.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We traversed the narrow cobblestone streets of Lutry, proceeding at a snail’s pace next to people walking through town before emerging onto paved roads and picking up speed. We passed numerous terraces - vineyards lined neatly in deep green rows on hill after hill after hill. The breeze was wonderful. The lake sparkled a short distance below. Everyone snapped so many photos that if we pooled our shots together, the entire fifteen-minute journey could probably be recreated in VR.
    </p>
    
    <div class="centered_img">

    </div>
    
    <p>
        The wine cave was next to the lake, just one town over from Lutry. It so strongly resembled Lutry that I wondered whether we’d driven in a loop. We were greeted by a tour guide who hailed from California. She walked us into the dim “cave”, organized everyone among little wooden picnic tables, and introduced us to the wine cave’s owner.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The owner, a short, serious middle-aged man, poured the first round. It was a white. The atmosphere was chaotic. Children and non-wine-drinkers were offered small cups of a fancy homemade apple juice. There wasn’t much of it and some visitors, working hard at getting their money’s worth, urged their kids to ask for more. The wine cave owner saw through the ploy and was mildly irritated. He hadn’t expected so many non-drinkers. He reluctantly opened a second jug. The tour guide tried to be a good hostess, making light conversation with every group and giving travel suggestions based on their stories.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The wine cave owner tried to address everyone in English - an attempt, perhaps, at relaying additional details about the vineyards and the varietals we were consuming. Unfortunately, he couldn’t rise above the noise of children yelling and adults ignorantly yakking amongst themselves. The tour guide hollered and clapped - grade school techniques - to capture everyone’s attention. Maybe many adults didn’t realize there was more to a wine tasting than the drink itself - or maybe lingual and cultural barriers kept them from appreciating that kind of discourse anyway so they’d learned to ignore it. Anyway, the tour guide “convinced” a few kiddies to go outside to the playground. The Chinese crew kept their children closeby.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The tasting had to move forward. With little introduction, the wine cave owner poured the second round - a red. In the crowded, noisy cave, I couldn’t concentrate to savor sips. For a red, it was surpisingly clear and light and didn’t have much body.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Between sustaining conversations with everyone, pouring wine, and serving juice, the tour guide eventually convinced the Chinese families to let their kids go to the playground, too - “it’s safe in Switzerland” - “my kids walk alone to the playground all the time” - “you can see the play structure from here.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With the kids gone, you’d think adults would have space to chat, drink, and interact with the wine cave owner. Instead, a scene broke out. A man from the Chinese crew was angry because the owner wouldn’t serve him juice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        “Juice is for children,” the wine cave owner said. I didn’t hear his original words and can't say whether he was teasing, trying to offend, or lightly stating a perceived fact.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Chinese man demanded to be served juice. He claimed to have a health condition that prevented him from consuming alcohol.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The tour guide was confused because she had offered him wine earlier and he had accepted. According to the Chinese man, she had asked if he wanted a taste and he took it because he did, in fact, want a taste… but he had a non-drinking ticket and deserved to be served juice. The term, taste, seemed to hold different meanings in their minds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The wine cave owner, understandably annoyed at how everyone was abusing his drinks and hospitality, refused to give the man juice. The man asked for his money back. Then he sat at an empty picnic table, crossed his arms, and pouted. It was as if the hosts had committed a serious offense.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Eventually, the conflict faded into the background and conversation slowly picked up again. The other adults in the Chinese crew talked amongst themselves about how wine makes them dizzy - vapid stories that didn’t move far beyond, “once, I had wine”. Maybe they truly didn’t understand that tastings could have an educational component.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The wine cave owner served the third round - another red. The tour guide asked how I enjoyed it. “It’s good,” I said, keeping the thought that it tasted too watery and young to myself. I expected better and wondered how the wine cave owner selected batches for these tastings.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Chinese man continued to pout. “I can’t drink alcohol. I have a health problem.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To my great disappointment, I noticed the man was wearing a Roots hat with a maple leaf on it. Roots is a popular quality clothing brand in Canada specializing in cold-weather gear, outdoor wear, and leather goods. Its logo is a beaver. Was the man a Canadian? Canadians don’t act like this. I’d read articles about people sporting Canadian symbols to get better treatment abroad. Was he just trying to take advantage of the label? The hat really bothered my sense of national pride - it never truly goes away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The tour guide seemed apologetic. She worked at giving me good travel suggestions for the leg of my trip. Over time, the mother and college-aged daughters also became more friendly. We chatted about our respective trips and learned we had similar itineraries - Bern, the Bernese Oberlands (though they went to Grindelwald instead of Mürren), and Montreux.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Far too soon, it was time to go. One little boy ran in from the playground and was so exhausted he could only lie, eyes-closed on the bench beside his parents.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We exited and reboarded the train. The tour guide stayed behind to welcome a second group of arrivals. The tired boy was sleeping soundly. The Chinese crew was glum. I sat in a strange mix of feelings and tried to enjoy the scenery.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On one hand, my intuition felt vindicated - these people were awful. On the other hand, I understood the ire on both sides all too well. The wine cave owner could’ve been more magnanimous and humble but he was probably tired of short-sighted, cheap tourists who weren’t really there to take in his wine and whatever information he had to share. The Chinese man could’ve been more respectful of unspoken rules, less entitled when told “no”... but maybe he was also reacting to a series of microaggressions that accumulated over days of travel in Europe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        “How are we so miserable right now?” someone from the Chinese crew remarked. As soon as the train fully stopped in Lutry, I heard one of them say, “kuài zhǒu” - “let’s go quickly” - and saw them speed walk toward the ticket window. They were hoping to get their money back before the tour guide got a chance to relay her side of the story... as if that would make everything better.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With heavy steps, I strolled back to the actual train station, singing a Leonard Cohen to soothe the weird funk. I walked beneath an underpass and my voice echoed deliciously against the hard concrete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The train was crowded and buzzing. I dismounted in Vevey. The town greeted me with a colorful madness and I couldn’t help but smile again.
    </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>
        The entire district was coming together for Fête des Vignerons, a wine-growers’ festival that takes place once every twenty years. At some point post-enlightenment, the local government realized positive reinforcement is better than negative reinforcement and decided that, instead of punishing its worst producers, it would reward the best. I’d been told by the tour guide that the city spent 14 million CFB to construct a new arena for the festivities.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A large swath of the local population was performing in the opening ceremonies. The night of my wine cave tour was just a few nights away from the opening. I watched as citizens gathered, proudly decked in striking robes and traditional gear for a dress rehearsal. I was reminded of Gilmore Girls - it felt like a Stars Hollow Miss-Patty-Dance-School production at an Olympic scale. How many cities in the world had the verve, pride, and cohesion to gather in this way?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The entire downtown space felt like a backstage. Some performers walked along the lakeside path, rushing to get to their assigned meeting places in time. Others waited, cordoned to their respective areas, for a chance to practice in the actual arena. Restaurants and bars were very much alive because, ultimately, the rehearsal was just another excuse to party.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And I was thirsty. My souvenir wine glass turned out to be the perfect vessel for fountain water (ok, maybe I was also slightly tipsy). I raised the glass to the mouth of a fountain and drank as I walked along the shores of Lake Geneva. I raised my glass again at the next fountain. Beneath a glowing sky and dusty sheets of violet and navy blue, I felt like I was walking through a surreal dream.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Eventually, as I moved away from the town center, the atmosphere calmed down. Starlight and calm waters... I returned to my hotel room, set an alarm in preparation for another packed day, and slept soundly.
