    It was closing time in Bern’s Old Town. The vendor at a dessert station located underneath a wide stone arcade was cleaning up for the day. The station was quickly reduced to a lone cart. The vendor unlocked a panel in an arcade column pushed a button, and watched as the platform supporting the cart descended underground. With another push of a button, a cover resembling the arcade floor closed over it. The vendor walked away.

                The gondola steadily rose towards a summit. Morning mist thickened into fog as it climbed. Upon arrival, passengers broke off to various lookout points. They looked up at the blue sky. They looked across at the numerous peaks lined up in the distance. They looked down at the rich grass, chalets and spindly rivers. They saw the fog below and realized they had passed through a cloud.

        The Schiltorn, a modest peak compared to the Jungfrau, has an interesting brand. In tourism booklets and webpages, it’s pushed as the filming location of a classic James Bond movie.

        The upper decks of the Piz Gloria offered lookout points, a restaurant, and cultural demos. In the lower deck, there was a museum with footage from In Her Majesty’s Secret Service, life-size props, and images of the cast accompanied by personal quotes. At first glance, the museum was a cheap, slightly outdated strategy for reeling in tourists.

        After walking through and taking in the stories of the actors, stunt doubles, videographers, and producers, however, I wondered whether the museum remains in part for their sake. It commemorates a special moment in their lives - a moment when they were on top of the world and in the midst of working together to make something spectacular.

        At first glance, inner Montreux was a little intimidating and offbeat. The streets were narrow and shady. The waiters weren’t the most friendly. Loitering teens seemed weirdly obsessed with drugs (or at least with talking loudly about drugs when diminuitive foreigners pass by). There was a preoccupation that I didn't understand with Freddy Mercury and music.

        Then I used the region’s public transit system.

                ... I stood, waiting for a bus. On the opposite side of the street, two pre-teens were waiting for the same bus at a different point in its journey. A young man biked past them, waved warmly, and said “hi XXX!” the way a camp counselor might greet a familiar charge. One kid waved vigorously and yelled an excited greeting back. His friend seemed impressed by the fact that he was close with a cool older guy.
            </li>
            <li>
                ... I sat on a bus as it made a stop. Passengers stepped off and others stepped on. A woman approached the front door. She didn’t step on. Instead, she started chatting with the driver. She asked how he was doing, she asked after his family... they seemed to be long-time friends who were delighted by the surprise encounter. Eventually, the bus continued on its way and she walked off.
            </li>
            <li>
                ... During work hours, many passengers are retired folks. A friendly older woman began chatting with me, asking about what I planned to see during my stay. Then she told me about the upcoming wine festival. It takes place every twenty years and she would be singing in its opening ceremonies. Impressed, I inquired further and she talked about how she was one of many - the citizens of Vevey had come together to plan the spectacle and they’d been rehearsing for months on end. She beamed as she shared that information.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sure, the Montreux Jazz Festival is renown internationally, and sure, the vineyards in Vaud are a Unesco-recognzied heritage site... but in spite of all that, the region presents very much as a small town.
