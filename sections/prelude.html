        I explored Switzerland solo over the course of ten days in July 2019.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <u>Zürich</u> is a quiet, elegant city.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Bern</u> is polished and idyllic. Its Old Town is a medieval district lifted straight out of a fairytale.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Mürren</u> is a verdant mountain side repose dotted with chalets. There’s a moment when you realize the mist that sporadically gathers and dissipates is the stuff of clouds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Montreux</u> and <u>Vevey</u> are two small cities with strong French roots that border the northeast coast of Lake Geneva.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Geneva</u> is an international city bustling with ambulants from all over the world.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    Because photos don't cut through and because traveling on your own can be an introverted, cerebral experience, here are a few vignettes for the memory box (and for your entertainment!).
