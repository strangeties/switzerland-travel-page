        For a historic space, Bern’s city center is an interesting mix of old and new. There are walls hailing from the twelfth century. A five-hundred-year-old well was found beneath some construction and rightfully annotated and preserved. Simultaneously, the presence of tram lines and summer construction projects kept me anchored to the present.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I found the perfect spot to appreciate this juxtaposition. The historic district has large, ornate fountains, many of which occupy the centers of various cobblestone streets. One such fountain was flanked by two tram tracks. The tracks curved around the fountain before resuming their regular positions at the center of each side of the road.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sitting on a bench next to the fountain with my back toward the fountain, I watched as tram after tram rushed toward me, only to bend at the last moment. Relaxing in the middle of a road, I felt like I was breaking unspoken norms. I felt oddly powerful.

        It was late afternoon on my second day in Bern and my feet were killing me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Compounded on the previous days' wanderings, my uninitiated feet carried me all over the wider city space. I crossed the Kornehausbrüke bridge with 7 a.m. commuters and took a long and winding route (i.e. I got lost) to Lorrainebad, a pool north of the city. I scaled the 344 steps of the Berner Münster. On my way to Marzilibad, the city’s largest pool area and the last stop for swimmers exiting the Aare before a series of rapids, I passed locals breaking for lunch in bright, carefully curated public parks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was Monday and several large museums were closed. After the pool, I walked past a square full of museums and wandered through the historic district for the umpteenth time, first on a self-guided tour, then on a mission to seek out all the nooks and crannies, all the corners that could be picked out from distant vantage points.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I wanted to keep going. I wanted to rest. My feet hurt. I contemplated purchasing a Thai foot massage. Walking into a new space, I spotted the perfect repose. Two women sat on rocks in the middle of a small man-made creek. Cool water from the Aare rushed over them. I ventured over, sat down, and found relief for my aching feet.

        After a series of early morning transfers between trains and a gondola, I arrived in Mürren at 10 a.m. The setting was gray. My fellow riders gathered at the large, open concrete look-out area next to the train station. The hubbub suggested world-class views but I could only see a patch of slate-gray and white. Everything else was obfuscated by fog and soon, the patch disappeared, too.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I moved on, following signs until I reached my cliff-side hotel. I left my heavy, ungainly traveler’s backpack behind the check-in counter and walked away with a light hiking sack. I eventually regained a sense of direction and realized I was hungry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I wandered - slightly aimlessly - on concrete paths, delighted by distant grassy hills and homey chalets. I felt like a Roller Coaster Tycoon sprite, a lone member of the crowd that spilled into Mürren at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday morning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In an area where multiple paths converged, I found a Co-op convenience store. A fellow tourist was unimpressed but the idea of a sandwich was heavenly to me. In spite of the baked goods I had for breakfast, realized I was hungry. I purchased the strangest item I could find - open pieces of bread with smoked salmon on one side and a well-mashed tuna salad on the other. I also grabbed a plastic container full of smooth, spherical red berries. I asked the cashier about my purchase, pointing specifically at the strange berries. “We call it food,” she snarked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Signs were slightly misleading but eventually, I found the tourist center in a recreation building. I had a general to-do list in mind but after Bern’s minor timing mishaps, I decided to study my options thoroughly and seek advice from a local. She helped me lay out an itinerary and even called to schedule a tandem parasailing session. I left satisfied, feeling like a student who did her homework.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The hills were calling. I walked onwards and upwards. I passed a playground and BBQ area. Firewood was readily available in a shed for anyone who cared to use it. A few picnic benches sat expectantly; however, the metallic angles of a gondola station detracted from the overall view.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I kept going, leaving the main trail for a path of flattened grass. I saw an open slope full of wildflowers. There was a hut with signs and tools for snowboarders and skiers. I sat down. I broke the packaging of my exotic open-faced sandwiches and started snacking. Lunch on day 4 was my favorite meal of the entire trip.

        I was riding a bike along paths in north Geneva. My goal was to reach Versoix, 4 miles north of the Jet d’Eau. It was my first and last Sunday in the city. It was my last day in Switzerland. It was also the day of the Musselman triathlon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the waterfront, I imitated bolder bikers and learned to confidently navigate tents and crowds (funny how people move out of the way when a fast-moving vehicle approaches...). At Perle du Lac, I stopped for a sip of chilled white wine. A triathlon, I thought, no problem!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It became a problem in the park. The runners’ path was cordoned off and in the ensuing tangle, it criss-crossed with every other trail to an absurd degree. I biked in 10-second bursts, dismounting in between to walk my bike under yellow tape.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Momentarily, I followed a family of four, hoping they’d know where to go. The mother carried a tote with a baguette sticking out. She kindly lifted the yellow tape for me to walk under. The father talked on the phone to someone they were probably planning to meet. They eventually gave up on their Sunday picnic plans. I did, too. I rode across the river to a flea market in Plainpalais instead.

        A few weeks after my travels, I flipped through a Google doc containing scribbles of song lyrics I wrote during the trip. The lyrics were mostly terrible but they conveniently revived memories of their creation.
    </p>

            ...playing at an open window-sill that doubled as a fire-escape in Bern, trying to sneak peeks of the city by night between strums

            ...waiting, predawn, on a cliffside balcony in Mürren: watching the early morning sun cast light on a river of mist, watching the clouds dissipate and reveal frozen summits in the distance

            ...sitting on a park bench in Interlaken, thinking through lyrics as a flock of paragliders made their slow descent...

        Slinging my ukulele along, I heaved a song-a-day challenge upon myself. Somehow, I remained loyal to the cause, starting one new song each day (or two if I missed one). I completed none but let it be because I was on vacation and some song ideas were directionless and uninspired while others would need time to marinate and develop. Finding a little box of consolidated memories in the document was a nice surprise - a gift from a past self.
